# Banking-Software
 A generic banking software used in majority of banks. Very simple and easy to understand.
Just replace the default values to your liking.
Remember to give me credit. :)

UPDATE
gets() does not seem to work on some C++ compilers. Try other functions or use a loop to insert the value.
It works fine on Turbo C++. If you are using Turbo C++, make the following changes:
 1. Add '.h' to all header files
 2. Remove 'using namespace std;'
 3. Replace 'system("CLS");' with 'clrscr()'
